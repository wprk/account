## Description

A simple authentication service written in TypeScript using the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) framework and bootstrapped using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository can be used in conjuction with my [auth](https://github.com/wprk/auth) backend service to build out a full login / registration system.

## WIP

This is a WIP and has been cloned from a personal private repository. Although it may be useful for reference this is not currently usable as an off-the-shelf authentication frontend and will require some work to customise it to your own needs. I will be looking to clean it up to remove all the custom stuff and make it a useable boilerplate when I have time. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wprk/account.git
cd account
yarn install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the app

# development
yarn start
```

## Test
